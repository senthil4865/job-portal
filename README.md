1.How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
since this is just a small app,we dont need even context API,and we can go with app level state,but its always a better practice to use context API for small apps and Redux for medium to large apps for state management

2.Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
I started off with app level state and refactored some components by including redux.Because of lack of time,some components still using app level state.
Used redux for practice and also making the app extensible in future.

3.What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
  I focus on quality rather than quantity,if more time is given,but coming to this project,i'll refactor frontend completely and will do api's using express.
